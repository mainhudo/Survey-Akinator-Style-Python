# Survey-Akinator-Style-Python
My original code. Answer 5 questions and I will tell you your favorite artists! 
HOW TO USE THIS CODE:

1. Open a PYTHON Terminal ( I used IDLE Python GUI 3.5 ) 
2. Open Notepad and write the questions down. 
3. Save the file to the name exactly as the one you will open using file handle (tuf96473Questios.txt for me)

Make sure that the text file name that contains the questions has the same name as what is in the code: 

      f = open('tuf96473Questions.txt', mode = 'r')
      
 4. The rest is history. Enjoy!
